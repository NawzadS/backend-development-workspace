# Backend Development Workspace
**Name:** Nawzad Saeed  
**School:** University of Helath Sciences and Pharmacy

## Overview
This repository is my backend development workspace for this course. It will hold unit projects, notes, and resources as I learn backend development, REST APIs, databases, testing, and version control.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to design and build RESTful APIs.
- Understand SQL and database design for backend apps.
- Master Git and safe deployment workflows.
- Practice writing tests and deploying small backend services.

## How I will use this repo
I will store project folders for each unit, keep a learning log, save useful links and my Git cheat-sheet, and push regular commits to track progress.

## Why version control matters
Version control lets me track changes, revert mistakes, and collaborate safely. It prevents deployment disasters and keeps work organized.
